    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Sup. My name is Jaime Rios. I'm currently a research coordinator in the Poldrack lab at Stanford University.
      I am broadly interested in Cognitive Control, more specifically the neural mechanisms underpinning it's adaptive and flexible nature. I am curious about what happens in the brain when we make errors on a task. How do we adapt our behavior and adjust our performance to meet the tasks at hand? What are the nuances within cognitive control that allows us to adapt our behavior to meet task demands? How do different aspects of Cognitive Control such as working memory, task set shifting, distractor intereference, or inhibition interact with eachother modulate behavior? These are some of the questions I am interested in.

    <p> I am a first generation pretty much everything. I went to community college for 3 years at Cosumnes River College where I studied computer science and psychology. I eventually transferred to UC Davis, where I studied both psychology and sociology. During my time at UC Davis I volunteered as an undergraduate research assistant in various labs spanning various aspects of psychology, from personality, to social psychology, to metascience. I currently find my home in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience and am aiming to apply for a PhD in cognitive psychology or cognitive neuroscience in the near future.</p>

    <p> Some of my current projects include connecting disparate cognitive control phenomona under the umbrella of sequential control using factor analysis and hierearchical clustering to hopefully provide a more cohesive perspective on trial to trial control based effects within the cognitive control literature. I am also working on understanding the nature of inhibition within the contect of exerting control in an enviornment where control is shared, say with ai agents. I hope to start a project soon that will look at the interaction between different aspects of cognitive control within a dual-task paradigm across several different tasks.
