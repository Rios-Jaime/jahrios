        <h3 class="subtitle">Context Statement</h3>
        <p class="bio">
        I am a Cognitive Neuroscientist in the Psychology and Neuroscience department at Duke University. 
        My primary research focuses on understanding the neural and behavioral underpinnings of 
        cognitive control over our ability to switch between perception and memory.
        </p>

        <p class="bio">
        My teaching practices are inspired by my previous and current mentors and are grounded in 
        principles of accessibility, transparency, and accountability in science, with a strong 
        emphasis on mentoring students from underrepresented backgrounds. I have served as instructor
        , discussion section and lab leader, and guest lecturer across multiple undergraduate 
        courses (Cognitive Neuroscience, Research Methods, Python Programming).
        </p>

        <p class="bio">
        Across all teaching roles, I strive to promote accountability, creativity, and healthy 
        skepticism through active learning, discussion-based instruction, and collaborative practices 
        that encourage students to engage in scientific discourse within open and supportive environments.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Designing and Planning for Learning Activities</h3>
        <p class="bio">
       My approach to designing and planning learning activities is guided by the belief that students learn most effectively when they are active participants in the process of scientific inquiry, rather than passive recipients of information. Drawing on my experiences as a cognitive neuroscientist, I have designed activities that emphasize the scientific process including hypothesis generation, critical evaluation of evidence, and iterative problem-solving in a way that is accessible for students of all backgrounds, with the express aim to provide them with the tools to engage in research in the future. For example, as a python instructor for undergraduate students in the <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/cogneuroresearchinternship/">Cognitive Neuroscience Research Internship (CNRI) program at Duke University</a>, I , alongside other Cog Neuro colleagues,  have developed a series of hands-on programming exercises/projects that allow students to apply programming concepts to real-world applications that they would encounter in the research setting. The course typically runs across 11 weeks, and has been designed to help students build up an understanding of basic python programming from basic syntax to more complex structures while applying this knowledge towards more research oriented endeavors such as developing cognitive tasks, analyzing data, and visualizing acquired data. Consisting of 8 to 10 students each semester, we begin the course by having students complete programming exercises in a flipped-classroom format, attempting to encourage them to get hands-on experience and real-time feedback as they start to learn how to engage with python. We eventually transition towards explicitly working with PyschoPy, a commonly used python package and GUI for creating cognitive tasks in the field. The exercises and flipped format are specifically designed to encourage collaboration between students and allows me as the instructor to provide on the spot guidance and feedback. We have also embedded a more overarching project completed across the course timeline, geared towards allowing students to actively engage in the research practice, where students propose a research idea and then develop a cognitive task to test such idea, culminating in a testable task that they use to gather data from their fellow colleagues in the course and then present the results for as a final project. The project has been designed to be built alongside their increasing understanding of the material, so as they learn increasing levels of python they can build up their tasks and analyses. The aim is for this course to provide students, not simply with the tools to engage in research, but the experience for them to reference as they shape their relationship with science. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Teaching and Supporting Student Learning</h3>
        <p class="bio">
        In discussions that I have led (cognitive neuroscience, research methods) or courses I instruct (python programming), my teaching approach centers around fostering an interactive and collaborative learning environment. I believe that it’s important for students to actively engage in problem solving themselves and apply what they learn. One such example comes in the form of a course I designed (mentioned previously) that aims to teach undergraduates how to use python in the research setting. In this course, due to its flipped format we instill not just a collaborative environment, but also an open environment where students can actively ask questions and obtain feedback as they engage with the material. Typically, I provide short demos for students to follow and practice basic python functions, and afterwards they can apply this information in exercises while I walk around the room. By establishing a one-on-one relationship this not only makes students more comfortable speaking up, but allows me to tailor explanations as they need it across various applications of the material. I also get the opportunity to help these students develop a scientific lens as they develop their semester project. By meeting with them across the 11 weeks of the course to discuss their research project, I am able to guide their questions/ideas towards a more feasible direction. There have been many instances where students have come in with beautifully creative ideas, but either didn’t know how to adapt them to the computer screen or didn’t have a clear scientific direction. For example, one group of students want to measure the effects of creativity on cognitive processes. They originally wanted to do a study that involved painting in various environments. While this idea is highly naturalistic, it might not be feasible both in terms of the scope of the class, but also with regards to the relationships at play. However, we were able to turn this initial idea into a project that has participants list various object uses and then conduct a memory-association task afterwards. This allowed them to map their ideas into workable tasks, but also promoted thinking about the relationships they were interested in and how to properly measure them. I aim to provide students with an environment where they feel comfortable enough to make mistakes and question what they are doing so they can begin to think for themselves.
