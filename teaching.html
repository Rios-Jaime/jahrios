        <h3 class="subtitle">Context Statement</h3>
        <p class="bio">
        I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Psychology and Neuroscience department at Duke University. 
        My primary research focuses on understanding the neural and behavioral underpinnings of 
        cognitive control over our ability to switch between perception and memory.
        </p>

        <p class="bio">
        My teaching practices are inspired by my previous and current mentors and are grounded in 
        principles of accessibility, transparency, and accountability in science, with a strong 
        emphasis on mentoring students from underrepresented backgrounds. I have served as instructor
        , discussion section and lab leader, and guest lecturer across multiple undergraduate 
        courses (Cognitive Neuroscience, Research Methods).
        </p>

        <p class="bio">
        Across all teaching roles, I strive to promote accountability, creativity, and healthy 
        skepticism through active learning, discussion-based instruction, and collaborative practices 
        that encourage students to engage in scientific discourse within open and supportive environments.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Designing and Planning for Learning Activities</h3>
        <p class="bio">
        My approach to designing and planning learning activities is guided by the belief that students 
        learn most effectively when they are active participants in the process of scientific inquiry 
        rather than passive recipients of information. Drawing on my training as a cognitive neuroscientist, 
        I design activities that emphasize hypothesis generation, critical evaluation of evidence, and 
        iterative problem-solving. As a python instructor for undergraduate students for the <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/cogneuroresearchinternship/">Cognitive Neuroscience Research Internship (CNRI) program at Duke University</a>, 
        I have developed a series of hands-on coding exercises that allow students to apply programming 
        concepts to real-world applications, in the form of constructing cognitive tasks and analyzing/visualizing data. 
        I've designed the course to progressively build their skills from basic syntax to
         more complex structures useful in cognitive task construction.  With 8 to 10 students each semester, 
         these exercises are structured to encourage collaboration and peer learning, 
        with students working in pairs or small groups to solve problems and share insights. In order to ensure that the activities are accessible to all students, I make use of a flipped-classroom
         model where students are provided with preparatory materials (e.g., readings, video tutorials)
          prior to class sessions. This allows students to come to class ready to engage in hands-on
           activities and discussions, while also providing opportunities for individualized support and feedback during class as a way of scaffolding their learning. 
           Outside of in class exercises, students also are split into groups where they develop a research question and apply their coding skills to develop and implement a 
           cognitive task to address their question. Students then obtain data and present their findings at the end of the semester. Throughout this process, 
            I provide guidance and support to help students refine their research questions, troubleshoot coding issues, and interpret/visualize their results.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Teaching and Supporting Student Learning</h3>
        <p class="bio">
        In discussion that I lead (cognitie neuroscience) or courses I instruct (python programming), my teaching approach centers around fostering an
        interactive and collaborative learning environment. I believe that it’s important for students to actively engage in the problem solving themselves and apply what they learn in either 
        lectures prior to discussions or during readings. The best way I believe to promote such active engagement is by using a flipped-classroom 
        design. By making use of a flipped-classroom, students can actively engage in exercises in groups, while I provide one-on-one 
        assistance and help with any trouble shooting while using programs like Psychopy or JASP during class. I provide a short demo and then have students’ complete 
        exercises while I walk around and help anybody who is struggling or has any questions. By allowing students to work together, we promote 
        engagement and participation, while instilling a feeling of collaboration across them that is reminiscent of standard scientific practice. 
        Many times when students have questions, they are usually rather empirical and testable questions they can test themselves by simply adjusting lines of code or parameter on some software. 
        I often encourage students once they are finished with a given exercise to go ahead and break their code and experiment with new lines/formats, or imagine a different scenerio during discussion sections.
        Usually the part that is the most difficult for young scientists is embracing and seeking out failure as a platform for learning. I try to provide students with an environment 
        where they feel comfortable enough to make mistakes and question what they are doing so they can begin to think for themselves.
