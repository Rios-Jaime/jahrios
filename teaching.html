        <h3 class="subtitle">Context Statement</h3>
        <p class="bio">
        I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Psychology and Neuroscience department at Duke University. 
        My primary research focuses on understanding the neural and behavioral underpinnings of 
        cognitive control over our ability to switch between perception and memory.
        </p>

        <p class="bio">
        My teaching practices are inspired by my previous and current mentors and are grounded in 
        principles of accessibility, transparency, and accountability in science, with a strong 
        emphasis on mentoring students from underrepresented backgrounds. I have served as instructor
        , discussion section and lab leader, and guest lecturer across multiple undergraduate 
        courses (Cognitive Neuroscience, Research Methods).
        </p>

        <p class="bio">
        Across all teaching roles, I strive to promote accountability, creativity, and healthy 
        skepticism through active learning, discussion-based instruction, and collaborative practices 
        that encourage students to engage in scientific discourse within open and supportive environments.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Designing and Planning for Learning Activities</h3>
        <p class="bio">
        My approach to designing and planning learning activities is guided by the belief that students 
        learn most effectively when they are active participants in the process of scientific inquiry 
        rather than passive recipients of information. Drawing on my training as a cognitive neuroscientist, 
        I design activities that emphasize hypothesis generation, critical evaluation of evidence, and 
        iterative problem-solving. Perhaps my most enriching experience teaching has come in the form of being a co-instructor 
        for a python course as a part of the center for cognitive neuroscience’s Cognitive Neuroscience Research Internship (CNRI). 
        This course is one of two stand-alone courses that undergraduate students admitted to the program take and attend every week 
        throughout the semester <strong>[A2]</strong>. In this course, we not only teach undergraduate students how to program in python, 
        but we do this through the lens of developing their own cognitive task to answer a specific research question using current
        tools in the field such as PsychoPy <strong>[A4]</strong>. In this way, students learn not just how to program, but how to apply their skills in a scientific context.
        We strive to make python an accessible tool for students to take with them as they move forward in research. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Teaching and Supporting Student Learning</h3>
        <p class="bio">
        As a python instructor for undergraduates and as discussion leader for several courses (cognitive neuroscience, research methods), 
        I believe that it’s important for students to actively engage in the problem solving themselves and apply what they learn in either 
        lectures prior to discussions or during readings. The best way I believe to promote such active engagement is by using a flipped-classroom 
        design. By making use of a flipped-classroom, students can actively engage in programming exercises in groups, while I provide one-on-one 
        assistance and help with any trouble shooting that happens on site throughout class <strong>[A1,A2]</strong>. I provide a short demo and then have students’ complete 
        exercises while I walk around and help anybody who is struggling or has any questions <strong>[A3,A4]</strong>. By allowing students to work together, we promote 
        engagement and participation, while instilling a feeling of collaboration across them <strong>[V1]</strong>. The beautiful thing about python is that every tool 
        you learn stacks upon previous tools, providing students with natural avenues for further inquiry. So many times, when students have questions, 
        it ends up being a rather empirical and testable question they can test themselves by changing a few lines of code. I often encourage students 
        once they are finished with a given exercise to go ahead and break their code and experiment with new lines/formats. Across time I’ve realized 
        that what’s difficult for students about learning and applying a programming language is not the syntax or the logic, but mainly being afraid 
        to break what you make and truly understand what you’re writing. It’s similar to practicing science as a whole I believe, because usually the 
        part that is the most difficult for young scientists is embracing and seeking out the failure. I try to provide students with an environment 
        where they feel comfortable enough to make mistakes and question what they are doing so they can begin to think for themselves.
